This code suffers from a potential issue related to improper handling of the return value from `file_get_contents()`. If the file specified by the `$filename` variable does not exist, or if there is some issue in reading the file,  `file_get_contents()` will return `false`. The code does not check for this case, which can lead to unexpected behavior or errors. If `$contents` is false,  `json_decode()` will not produce the expected array, leading to subsequent errors. 
```php
<?php
$filename = 'data.json';
$contents = file_get_contents($filename);
$data = json_decode($contents, true);
print_r($data);
?>
```
