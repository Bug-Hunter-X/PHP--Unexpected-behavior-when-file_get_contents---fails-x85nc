# PHP: Handling file_get_contents() Errors
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP when using `file_get_contents()` to read JSON data and a solution to handle potential errors.  The initial code lacks error handling for the case where the file doesn't exist or can't be read.  The improved version includes robust error checking, providing better stability and preventing unexpected crashes.
